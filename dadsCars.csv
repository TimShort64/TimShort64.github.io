(W06)",1928,1932,33,"The Mercedes-Benz SSK (W06) is a roadster built by German automobile manufacturer Mercedes-Benz between 1928 and 1932. The name is an abbreviation of Super Sport Kurz, German for ""Super Sport Short"", as it was a short wheelbase development of the Mercedes-Benz Modell S. The SSK's extreme performance and numerous competitive successes made it one of the most highly regarded sports cars of its era.

The SSK was the last car designed for Mercedes-Benz by Ferdinand Porsche before he left to found his own company.[3][4] The SSK is an evolution of the 1927 Modell S (S for Sport) which was based on the Modell K (K for ""Kurzer Radstand"" which means short wheelbase) variant of the Mercedes-Benz Typ 630. The SSK chassis was 19 inches (480 mm) shorter than the Modell S to make the car even lighter and more agile for racing,[5] especially short races and hillclimbs.

Fitted with a supercharged single overhead camshaft 7-litre straight-6 engine[6][7] producing 200–300 metric horsepower (150–220 kW) and over 500 lb⋅ft (680 N⋅m) of torque (depending on the state of tune),[7] the SSK had a top speed of up to 120 miles per hour (190 km/h), making it the fastest car of its day.[8] The supercharger on the SSK's engine was operated by a clutch that was engaged by fully depressing the throttle pedal and then giving the pedal an extra push. Backing off the throttle pedal disengaged the supercharger clutch.

The S/SS/SSK line was one of the nominees in the penultimate round of voting for the Car of the Century award in 1999, as chosen by a panel of 132 motoring journalists and a public internet vote.

Fewer than 40 SSKs were built during its production span, of which about half were sold as Rennwagen (racing cars).[12] Many were crashed while racing and subsequently cannibalised for parts. Only four or five entirely original models remain, and their scarcity and rich heritage make them among the most sought after cars in the world; a 1929 model was auctioned at Bonhams in Chichester in September 2004 for £4.17 million (US$7.4 million), making it the second most expensive automobile ever sold at that time.

Intended to compete with the most luxurious and powerful cars in the world, it was introduced in 1928, the year before the stock market crash that led to the Great Depression. The Model J, available with a supercharger after 1932, was sold until Duesenberg Motors Company went bankrupt in 1937.

E. L. Cord, the owner of Auburn Automobile, and other transportation firms, bought the Duesenberg Motor Corporation on October 26, 1926, for the brothers' engineering skills, talent and brand name. He intended to produce a car to rival the size, power, and luxury of top European brands such as Hispano-Suiza and Rolls-Royce.[4]

After Cord's takeover, the new company was renamed ""Duesenberg, Inc."" Fred Duesenberg would continue in the new organization with the title of vice president in charge of engineering and experimental work.[5] Fred's brother August, who had played an important role in the development of the Model A and its variant, the rare X, had nothing to do with the initial design of the J and had no formal connection with Duesenberg, Inc. until later. According to the expert Marshall Merkes, ""Cord did not want Augie around.""[6] However, all Duesenberg racing cars produced after 1926 were built by Augie in an enterprise that functioned separately, and in a building apart from the main Duesenberg plant. He was also responsible for a number of engineering achievements like the superchargers developed for both the Auburn and Cord motorcars.

The newly revived Duesenberg company set about to produce the Model J, which debuted December 1 at the New York Car Show of 1928. In Europe, it was launched at the ""Salon de l'automobile de Paris"" of 1929. The first and — at the time of the New York presentation — only example made of the series, the J-101, was a LeBaron sweep panel dual cowl phaeton, finished in silver and black.[8] By the time the Great Depression hit in October 1929, the Duesenberg Company had only built some 200 cars. An additional 100 orders were filled in 1930. Thus, the Model J fell short of the original goal to sell 500 cars a year.[9] The newly revived Duesenberg company set about to produce the Model J, which debuted December 1 at the New York Car Show of 1928.

The Stellas, or Grand Renaults, were marked with a star riveted to the radiator grille above the famous Renault lozenge, a reference to models with names that ended in ""-stella"", which was a conscious reference to the Latin word for a ""star"".,[2] while ""reina"" is Spanish for ""queen"".

The Reinastella was, at 5.3 meters (17 feet) long and 2 meters (six feet) wide, the biggest car ever produced by Renault upon its market debut. It weighed about 2.5 tons and was the first Renault to be fitted with a 7.1 liter, 8-cylinder engine, delivering a top speed of 140 km/h (87 mph). It was also the first Renault to have its radiator placed ahead of the engine, leading the way for all future Renaults.

The hood of the Reinastella was longer than that of the later Nervastella and Vivastella, but like those later models the Reinastella was available in different trims: a closed sedan, berline, and town car. Coachbuilding was by leading French coachworkers, exhibiting the luxurious fittings of the golden age of classic bodywork. These models were produced until 1931.

In 1933, a coupé, the Reinasport, was introduced. It was a lighter and more economical car, designed to compete with British and American models in the difficult economic environment of the Great Depression.

In its day, the Reinastella had the same cachet of luxury and privilege in the Francophone world that Rolls-Royce had in Britain and America. As a result, it may sometimes appear in contemporary popular media as a symbol of wealth. For example, it appears in The Adventures of Tintin series of Belgian comics The Blue Lotus (1936) and The Crab with the Golden Claws (1941).

Bore and stroke were 72 mm by 100 mm based on that of the Type 49 but heavily modified by Jean Bugatti, unlike the single cam engines of the Type 49 and earlier models.[3] The engines of the Type 50, 51 used bevel gears at the front of the engine to transmit power from the crankshaft, whereas the Type 57 used a train of spur gears at the rear of the engine, with fiber gear wheels on the camshafts to achieve more silence in operation.

The Type 57 chassis and engine was revived in 1951 as the Bugatti Type 101. A rediscovered Type 57 sold for 3.4 million euros at auction on 7 February 2009 at a motor show in Paris.

8,,Citroen,Traction Avant,1934,1956,"760,000","The Citroën Traction Avant (French pronunciation: [tʁaksjɔnaˈvɑ̃]) is the world's first monocoque-bodied, front-wheel drive, mass-production car.[2] A range of mostly 4-door saloons and executive cars, as well as longer wheelbased ""Commerciale"",[3] and three row seating ""Familiale"" models, were produced with four- and six-cylinder engines, by French carmaker Citroën from 1934 to 1957. With some 760,000 units built, the Traction Avants were the first front-wheel drives made in such (six-figure) quantity.

Whilst front-wheel drive and four-wheel independent suspension had been established in production cars by Auto Union,[citation needed] and subsequently by others a few years prior – the Traction Avant pioneered integrating these into a mass-production car with a crash resistant,[4] largely unitary, monocoque body. Additionally, the car was also an early adopter of rack and pinion steering.

Although the car's name emphasized its front-wheel drive power delivery (""Traction Avant"" literally means ""front traction""), the car stood out at least as much by its much lower profile and stance – made possible by the absence of a separate vehicle frame or chassis under the car's mostly unitary body – sharply distinguishing it visually from its taller contemporaries.

The Traction Avant's structure was a welded unitary body / chassis. Most other cars of the era were based on a separate frame (chassis) onto which the non-structural body (""coachwork"") was built. Unitary construction (also called Unit Body or ""Unibody"" in the US) results in a lighter vehicle, and is now used for virtually all car construction.[5][6]

This unitary body saved 70 kg (150 lb) in steel per car. It was mass-produced, using innovative technology purchased from the American firm Budd Company. Weight reduction was a motivation for Citroën that American manufacturers of that time did not have.[7]

This method of construction was viewed with great suspicion in many quarters, with doubts about its strength. A type of crash test was conceived, taking the form of driving the car off a cliff, to illustrate its great inherent resilience.",
8,,Chrysler,Airflow,1934,1937,"29,600","The Chrysler Airflow holds a special place in automotive history as one of the most innovative and influential cars of the 1930s.

The Chrysler Airflow was developed in the early 1930s by Chrysler Corporation under the direction of engineer Carl Breer and designer Owen Skelton. It was conceived as a radical departure from traditional car design, with a focus on aerodynamics, streamlining, and advanced engineering principles.

The Chrysler Airflow made its debut in 1934 as a 1934 model year car. It was introduced amid much anticipation and fanfare, as it represented a significant departure from conventional car design at the time.

The most striking feature of the Chrysler Airflow was its advanced aerodynamic design, characterized by its streamlined body, integrated headlights, and smooth, flowing lines. The design was influenced by principles of aerodynamics and was intended to improve fuel efficiency, stability, and performance.

The Chrysler Airflow incorporated several engineering innovations, including a unitized body construction, which allowed for a lighter and more rigid structure. It also featured a rear-mounted engine and a front axle moved forward to improve weight distribution and handling.

Despite its advanced design and engineering, the Chrysler Airflow faced challenges in the marketplace. Consumers were initially skeptical of its unconventional appearance, and sales were disappointing compared to more traditional cars of the era. However, the Airflow's design and engineering innovations would influence future automotive design and engineering practices.

Although sales of the Chrysler Airflow were modest, its impact on automotive design and engineering cannot be overstated. The Airflow introduced concepts such as streamlining, aerodynamics, and unitized construction to the automotive industry, setting the stage for future advancements in car design. Many of its innovations, such as integrated body design and improved passenger safety, would be adopted by other automakers in the years to come.

Production of the Chrysler Airflow ceased in 1937 after only a few model years. Despite its relatively short production run, the Airflow left a lasting legacy and remains a symbol of innovation and forward-thinking design in the automotive world.

Overall, the Chrysler Airflow stands as a testament to the ingenuity and vision of its designers and engineers, pushing the boundaries of automotive design and paving the way for future advancements in the industry.",red tow truck
9,,Audi,"Rekordwagen Avus
(Type B)",1935,1935,4,"The Auto Union Grand Prix racing cars types A to D were developed and built by a specialist racing department of Auto Union's Horch works in Zwickau, Germany, between 1933 and 1939, after the company bought a design by Dr. Ferdinand Porsche in 1933. The Auto Union type B streamlined body was designed by Paul Jaray.

Of the 4 Auto Union racing cars, the Types A, B and C, used from 1934 to 1937 had supercharged V16 engines, and the final car, the Type D used in 1938 and 1939 (built to new 1938 regulations), had a supercharged 3L V12 that developed almost 550 horsepower. All of the designs were difficult to handle due to extreme power/weight ratios (wheelspin could be induced at over 100 mph (160 km/h)), and marked oversteer due to uneven weight distribution (all models were tail heavy). The Type D was easier to drive because of its smaller, lower mass engine that was better positioned toward the vehicle's center of mass.

Between 1935 and 1937, Auto Unions won 25 races, driven by Ernst von Delius, Tazio Nuvolari, Bernd Rosemeyer, Hans Stuck and Achille Varzi. Auto Union proved particularly successful in the 1936 and 1937 seasons. Their main competition came from the Mercedes Benz team, which also raced sleek, silver cars. Known as the Silver Arrows, the cars of the two German teams dominated Grand Prix racing until the outbreak of World War II in 1939.

In 1932 Auto Union Gmbh was formed, comprising struggling auto manufacturers Audi, DKW, Horch and Wanderer. The chairman of the board of Directors, Baron Klaus von Oertzen wanted a show piece project, so at fellow director Adolf Rosenberger's insistence, von Oertzen met with Porsche, who had done work for him before.[2]

The rear mid-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout was unusual at the time. From front to rear the layout comprised radiator, driver, fuel tank, and engine. The layout would return to Grand Prix racing in the late 1950s by British manufacturer Cooper Car Company.

The problem with early mid-engined design was the stiffness of the contemporary ladder chassis and suspension. The car's turning angle changed as the momentum of the centrally mounted engine increased on the chassis, causing oversteer. All Auto Unions had independent suspension, with parallel trailing arms and torsion bars at the front. At the rear, Porsche tried to counter the tendency to oversteer by using a then-advanced swing axle suspension on the early cars. On the later Type D, rear suspension was a de Dion system, following the lead of Mercedes-Benz, but the supercharged engines eventually produced almost 550 horsepower, which exacerbated the oversteer.

The original Porsche-designed V16 was modified as a V12 when in 1938 the Grand Prix regulations set a limit of 3 litres on supercharged engines. Originally designed as a 6-litre, the first Auto Union engines displaced 4,360 cc and developed 295 PS (217 kW). They had two cylinder blocks, inclined at an angle of 45 degrees, with a single overhead camshaft to operate all 32 valves. The intake valves in the hemispherical cylinder heads were connected to the camshaft by rocker arms, while for the exhaust valves the rocker arms were connected to the camshaft by pushrods that passed through tubes situated above the spark plugs; thus the engine had three valve covers. The engine provided optimum torque at low engine speeds, and Bernd Rosemeyer later drove an Auto Union around the Nürburgring in a single gear to prove the engine's flexibility.

The body underwent wind-tunnel testing at the German Institute for Aerodynamics, a scientific organization that still exists. With the fuel tank located in the centre of the car directly behind the driver, the front-rear weight distribution remained unchanged as the fuel was used; the same location is used in modern open-wheel racing cars for the same reason. The chassis tubes originally piped coolant from the radiator to the engine, but this was eventually abandoned owing to leaks.

The development of Auto Union racing cars began 1933 by specialists of Horch works. The first cars ran in the winter 1933/34, on the Nürburgring, AVUS and Monza. Further development was stopped completely in 1942.

Unlike Mercedes, who had former racing driver turned designer Rudolf Uhlenhaut, who could provide excellent feedback on the car and required developments; Auto Union were forced to create in-car measuring systems to provide additional feedback. Auto Union used a clockwork mechanism and a paper disc to record data such as engine revs while the car was being tested, allowing the engineers to study the collected data at a later date.[3] It was found that additional work was needed on the car's cornering behaviour, as accelerating out of a corner would cause the inside rear wheel to spin furiously. This was much abated by the use of a Porsche innovation, limited slip differential, manufactured by ZF, which was introduced at the end of the 1935 season.

Co-operation between Porsche and Auto Union continued through the Types A, B and C, until the 750 kg (1,650 lb) formula ended in 1937, as engineering developments had resulted in engines producing great horsepower in lightweight vehicles, and hence high speeds and excessive accidents. Dr. Ing. Robert Eberan von Eberhorst was responsible for the new Type D car,[citation needed] which while still retaining the 750 kg (1,650 lb) minimum weight, also restricted capacity to 3 litres with a supercharger, or 4.5 litres without. The Type D employed a 12-cylinder engine, while the hillclimb versions, where the capacity limit was not enforced, used a different gearbox and final drive to retain the 16-cylinder engine of the Type C.",

9,,VW,"Beetle (a.k.a. Bug)
(Type 1)",1938,2003,"21,529,464","The Volkswagen Beetle—officially the Volkswagen Type 1,[a] is an economy car that was built by the German company Volkswagen (VW) from 1938 until 2003.[7] It has a rear-engine design with a two-door body style and is intended for five occupants (later, Beetles were restricted to four people in some countries).[8][9][10]

The need for a people's car (Volkswagen in German), its concept and its functional objectives were formulated by the leader of Nazi Germany, Adolf Hitler, who wanted a cheap, simple car to be mass-produced for his country's new road network (Reichsautobahn). Members of the National Socialist party, with an additional dues surcharge, were promised the first production, but the Spanish Civil War shifted most production resources to military vehicles to support the Nationalists under Francisco Franco.

Lead engineer Ferdinand Porsche and his team took until 1938 to finalise the design. Béla Barényi[11] is credited with conceiving the original basic design for this car in 1925, notably by Mercedes-Benz, on their website, including his original technical drawing,[12][13] five years before Porsche claimed to have done his initial version.[14] The influence on Porsche's design of other contemporary cars, such as the Tatra V570, and the work of Josef Ganz remains a subject of dispute.[15] The result was the first Volkswagen, and one of the first rear-engined cars since the Brass Era. With 21,529,464 produced,[16] the Beetle is the longest-running and most-manufactured car of a single platform ever made.

Although designed in the 1930s, due to World War II, civilian Beetles only began to be produced in significant numbers by the end of the 1940s. The car was then internally designated the Volkswagen Type 1, and marketed simply as the Volkswagen. Later models were designated Volkswagen 1200, 1300, 1500, 1302, or 1303, the first three indicating engine displacement, the last two derived from the model number.

The car became widely known in its home country as the Käfer (German for ""beetle"", cognate with English chafer) and was later marketed under that name in Germany,[17] and as the Volkswagen in other countries. For example, in France it was known as the Coccinelle (French for ladybug).",several of them are in the collection
9,,Mercedes Benz,W154,1938,1939,16,"The Mercedes-Benz W154 was a Grand Prix racing car designed by Rudolf Uhlenhaut. The W154 competed in the 1938 and 1939 Grand Prix seasons and was used by Rudolf Caracciola to win the 1938 European Championship.

The W154 was created as a result of a rule change by the sports governing body AIACR, which limited supercharged engine capacities to 3000cc. Mercedes' previous car, the supercharged 5700cc W125, was therefore ineligible. The company decided that a new car based on the chassis of the W125 and designed to comply with the new regulations would be preferable to modifying the existing car.

Although using the same chassis design as the 1938 car, a different body was used for the 1939 season and the M154 engine used during 1938 was replaced by the M163. As a result of the new engine, the 1939 car is often mistakenly referred to as a Mercedes-Benz W163.

For the 1938 season, Grand Prix racing's governing body AIACR moved from a formula limited by weight to one by engine capacity. The new regulations allowed a maximum capacity of 3000cc with a supercharger or 4500cc without. This meant Mercedes-Benz's previous car, the supercharged 5700cc W125, was ineligible to continue. Its new car was based on the W125 chassis, with a supercharged 3000cc engine determined after both types had been tested.",Silver car with racing # 12

Introduced at the 1948 Paris Mondial de l'Automobile,[1] it has an air-cooled engine that is mounted in the front and drives the front wheels.

Conceived by Citroën Vice-President Pierre Boulanger to help motorise the large number of farmers still using horses and carts in 1930s France,[4] the 2CV has a combination of innovative engineering and straightforward, utilitarian bodywork.[5][6][7] The 2CV featured overall low cost of ownership, simplicity of maintenance, an easily serviced air-cooled engine (originally offering 6.7 kW (9 hp)), and minimal fuel consumption. In addition, it had been designed to cross a freshly ploughed field with a basket full of eggs on the passenger's seat without breaking them, because of the great lack of paved roads in France at the time; with a long-travel suspension system,[8] that connects front and rear wheels, giving a very soft ride.

Often called ""an umbrella on wheels"",[9][10] the fixed-profile convertible bodywork featured a full-width, canvas, roll-back sunroof, which accommodated oversized loads, and until 1955 even stretched to cover the car's trunk, reaching almost down to the car's rear bumper. Michelin introduced and first commercialised the revolutionary new radial tyre design with the introduction of the 2CV.

A 1953 technical review in Autocar described ""the extraordinary ingenuity of this design, which is undoubtedly the most original since the Model T Ford"".[16] In 2011, The Globe and Mail called it a ""car like no other"".[17] The motoring writer L.

The 300 SL traces its origins to the company's 1952 racing car, the W194, and was equipped with a mechanical direct fuel injection system that significantly increased the power output of its three-liter overhead camshaft straight-six engine.

The 300 SL was capable of reaching speeds of up to 263 km/h (163 mph), earning it a reputation as a sports car racing champion and making it the fastest production car of its time. The car's iconic gullwing doors and innovative lightweight tubular-frame construction contributed to its status as a groundbreaking and highly influential automobile.

The designation ""SL"" is an abbreviation of the German term ""super-leicht,"" meaning ""super-light,"" a reference to the car's racing-bred lightweight construction.

Its structure, however, was radically different, with innovative monocoque construction and slippery aerodynamics that integrated aviation technology, including in some examples a distinctive vertical stabilizer.

Engine displacement began at 3.4 litres, was enlarged to 3.8 L in 1957, and reduced to 3.0 L in 1958 when Le Mans rules limited engines for sports racing cars to that maximum. D-Types won Le Mans in 1955, 1956 and 1957. After Jaguar temporarily retired from racing as a factory team, the company offered the remaining unfinished D-Types as street-legal XKSS versions, whose perfunctory road-going equipment made them eligible for production sports car races in America.

Internally referred to as W121 (BII or B2), it was first shown in prototype at the 1954 New York Auto Show, and was available with an optional removable hardtop.

The 190 SL presented an attractive, more affordable alternative to the exclusive Mercedes-Benz 300 SL, sharing its basic styling, engineering, detailing, and fully independent suspension. Both cars had double wishbones in front and swing axles at the rear. Instead of the 300 SL's expensive purpose-built W198 tubular spaceframe, the 190 SL's R121 structure used a shortened unitary floorpan modified from the W121 base saloon.[2]

The 190 SL was powered by a new, slightly oversquare 105 PS (77 kW; 104 hp) Type M121 BII 1.9 L straight-four SOHC engine. Based on the 300 SL's straight six,[3] it had an unchanged 85 mm bore and 4.3 mm reduced 83.6 mm stroke, was fitted with twin-choke dual Solex carburetors, and produced gross 120 hp (89 kW; 122 PS).[3] In detuned form, it was later used in the W120 180 and W121 190 models.

The car was available either as a soft-top convertible (initially priced at DM 16,500/US$3,998[4]) or with removable hardtop (DM 17,650/$4,295). A small third-passenger transverse seat was optional.

They were faster and more expensive than the Beetle, but very cramped in the back, despite their wider, postwar and nearly slabsided body design. Two years later, in 1957, a convertible was added.

Three companies and numerous individuals came together in the history of the Karmann Ghia. In the early 1950s, Volkswagen was producing its Volkswagen Beetle, and as postwar standards of living increased, executives at Volkswagen were at least receptive to adding a halo model to its range, if not actively seeking an additional model. Luigi Segre was committed to expanding the international reputation of Carrozzeria Ghia. And Wilhelm Karmann had taken over his family coachbuilding firm Karmann and was eager to augment his contracts building Volkswagen's convertible models.

Wilhelm Karmann and Luigi Segre often encountered each other at international automobile shows, and after an initial discussion prompted by Wilhelm Karmann, Segre secretly obtained[5] a Volkswagen Beetle to use as a basis for a prototype[6] – Beetles were difficult to come by and Gian Paolo, Mario Boano's son, purchased one in Paris and drove it back to Turin.[7] Ghia customized its platform, designed the initial prototype and in five months constructed the model. Segre secretly presented the model to Wilhelm Karmann one year after the initial discussion — late in 1953, in Paris, at the Societé France Motors factories (Volkswagen's dealership for France and the exclusive European dealer of Ghia-built Chrysler models).[8] When Wilhelm Karmann saw the coupé, Karmann said, ""I'd like to build that!""[9] As the head of Ghia, Segre singularly directed the project through conception and prototyping, delivering a feasible project that Willhelm Karmann both wanted to and could practically build — the project Wilhelm Karmann would in turn present to Volkswagen.

After Volkswagen approved the design in November 1953, the Karmann Ghia debuted (at the 1955 Paris and Frankfurt[11] auto shows and at the Kasino Hotel in Westfalia, Germany, on July 14, 1955)[15] and went into production, first at Ghia[9] and then in Osnabrück — ultimately to reach a production over 445,000, running 19 years virtually unchanged.",
13,,Sudebaker,Speedster,1955,1955,"2,215","From its start in 1852 when Henry and Clement Studebaker opened a blacksmith shop downtown, to the 26,000 employees who worked for the company at its peak producing a total of 4.2 million vehicles, the company endures as a legacy.

Studebaker was an American wagon and automobile manufacturer based in South Bend, Indiana, with a building at 1600 Broadway, Times Square, Midtown Manhattan, New York City.[1][2][3][4] Founded in 1852 and incorporated in 1868[5] as the Studebaker Brothers Manufacturing Company, the firm was originally a coachbuilder, manufacturing wagons, buggies, carriages and harnesses.

Studebaker entered the automotive business in 1902 with electric vehicles and in 1904 with gasoline vehicles, all sold under the name ""Studebaker Automobile Company"". Until 1911, its automotive division operated in partnership with the Garford Company of Elyria, Ohio, and after 1909 with the E-M-F Company and with the Flanders Automobile Company. The first gasoline automobiles to be fully manufactured by Studebaker were marketed in August 1912. Over the next 50 years, the company established a reputation for quality, durability and reliability.[7]

After an unsuccessful 1954 merger with Packard (the Studebaker-Packard Corporation) and failure to solve chronic postwar cashflow problems, the 'Studebaker Corporation' name was restored in 1962, but the South Bend plant ceased automobile production on December 20, 1963, and the last Studebaker automobile rolled off the Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, assembly line on March 17, 1966. Studebaker continued as an independent manufacturer before merging with Wagner Electric in May 1967[8] and then Worthington Corporation in November 1967[9] to form Studebaker-Worthington.

Ballooning labor costs (the company had never had an official United Auto Workers (UAW) strike and Studebaker workers and retirees were among the highest paid in the industry), quality control issues, and the new-car sales war between Ford and General Motors in the early 1950s wrought havoc on Studebaker's balance sheet.[6]: 254–55  Professional financial managers stressed short-term earnings rather than long-term vision. Momentum was sufficient to keep going for another 10 years, but stiff competition and price-cutting by the Big Three doomed the enterprise.

From 1950 Studebaker declined rapidly, and by 1954 was losing money. It negotiated a strategic takeover by Packard, a smaller but less financially troubled car manufacturer. However, the cash position was worse than it had led Packard to believe, and by 1956, the company (renamed Studebaker-Packard Corporation and under the guidance of CEO James J. Nance) was nearly bankrupt, though it continued to make and market both Studebaker and Packard cars until 1958.[6]: 254  The ""Packard"" element was retained until 1962, when the name reverted to ""Studebaker Corporation"".

In combination with Citroën's proven front-wheel drive, the DS was used competitively in rally racing during almost its entire 20‑year production run, and achieved multiple major victories, as early as 1959, and as late as 1974. It placed third in the 1999 Car of the Century poll recognizing the world's most influential auto designs and was named the most beautiful car of all time by Classic & Sports Car magazine.[6]

The name DS and ID are puns in the French language. ""DS"" is pronounced exactly like déesse, lit. 'goddess', whereas ""ID"" is pronounced as idée ('idea')

After 18 years of secret development as the successor to the Traction Avant, the DS 19 was introduced on 6 October 1955, at the Paris Motor Show. In the first 15 minutes of the show, 743 orders were taken, and orders for the first day totalled 12,000.[7] During the 10 days of the show, the DS took in 80,000 deposits; a record that stood for over 60 years,[8] until it was eclipsed by the Tesla Model 3 which received 180,000 first day deposits in March 2016.[9] The original list price for a 1959 ID19 was US$2,833 ($28,440 in 2022 dollars).[10][11]

Contemporary journalists said the DS pushed the envelope in the ride vs. handling compromise possible in a motor vehicle.[12][13][14]

To a France still deep in reconstruction after the devastation of World War II, and also building its identity in the post-colonial world, the DS was a symbol of French ingenuity.[15] The DS was distributed to many territories throughout the world.[16]


At the 1963 Amsterdam International Autoshow, Citroën presented a DS body as a sculpture, upright like a rocket, on a rotating platform.
It also posited the nation's relevance in the Space Age, during the global race for technology of the Cold War.[15] Structuralist philosopher Roland Barthes, in an essay about the car, said that it looked as if it had ""fallen from the sky"".[17] An American advertisement summarised this selling point: ""It takes a special person to drive a special car"".[18]

Because they were owned by the technologically aggressive tyre manufacturer Michelin, Citroën had designed their cars around the technologically superior radial tyre since 1948, and the DS was no exception.",
13,,Mercedes Benz,"300SLR
(W196)",1955,1955,9,"Mercedes-Benz produced a total of nine 300SLR (Sport Leicht-Rennen) racing cars. These cars were built for endurance racing and were campaigned in various races including the Mille Miglia, Targa Florio, and the 24 Hours of Le Mans.

The Mercedes-Benz 300 SLR (W 196 S) is a two-seat sports racing car that took part in the 1955 World Sportscar Championship before a catastrophic crash and fire at Le Mans later that year ended its domination prematurely. The car was designated ""SL-R"" (for Sport, Leicht, Rennen, eng: sport, light, racing version), which was later condensed to ""SLR"". Technically, the W 196 S is based on the W 196 R, but has a slightly different engine, displacing 3 litres.

Just as the W 196 R Formula One racer's M 196 R engine, the 300 SLR's M 196 S engine is a direct-injected 3-litre straight-eight engine (but with a 78 mm bore and stroke); its rated power is 302 PS (222 kW).[1]

The W 196 S's monoposto driving position was modified to standard two-abreast seating, headlights were added, and a few other changes made to adapt a strictly track competitor to a 24-hour road/track sports racer.

Hall of Fame Formula One driver and former Mercedes-Benz team 300 SLR race driver Stirling Moss described the 300 SLR as ""The greatest sports racing car ever built – really an unbelievable machine.""[2]

Two of the nine 300 SLR rolling chassis produced (nicknamed the ""Uhlenhaut Coupé"") were converted into 300 SLR/300 SL hybrids. Effectively road legal racers, they had coupé styling, gull-wing doors, and a footprint midway between the two models.

When Mercedes-Benz cancelled its racing programme after the Le Mans disaster, the hybrid project was shelved. Company design chief Rudolf Uhlenhaut, architect of both the 300 SLR racer and the hybrids, appropriated one of the leftover mules as his personal car. Capable of approaching 290 km/h (180 mph), the Uhlenhaut Coupé was by far the fastest road car in the world in its day.

A 1955 Mercedes-Benz 300 SLR Uhlenhaut Coupé has become the most expensive car to ever be sold after being auctioned off for €135 million. The car, previously owned by Mercedes-Benz, was sold by RM Sotheby’s to an unknown collector at the Mercedes-Benz Museum on 5 May 2022.",
13,,Mercedes Benz,"Rennwagen-Schnelltransport
('Racing Transporter')",1955,1956,7,"The Mercedes-Benz Rennwagen Schnelltransporter, often abbreviated as ""Rennwagen Transporter"" or simply ""Racing Transporter,"" was a specialized vehicle designed to transport Formula One race cars and equipment for the Mercedes-Benz racing team during the 1950s and 1960s.

In the 1950s, Mercedes-Benz was actively involved in motorsport, particularly Formula One racing. To support its racing efforts, Mercedes-Benz needed a reliable and efficient means of transporting its racing cars, spare parts, and equipment to various race circuits across Europe.
The idea for a dedicated racing transporter came about as a solution to the logistical challenges faced by the Mercedes-Benz racing team. Also interestingly, the company was highly secretive so didn't want to fix their racecars on-site at the race-circuit, so would transport them to/fro their headquarters for repairs. The Schnelltransporter could travel over 170 km/hr for hours on the Autobahn to get the job done.

The Rennwagen Schnelltransporter was developed in collaboration with Mercedes-Benz and the coachbuilder Karl Kling. It was based on a modified Mercedes-Benz O 3500 bus chassis.
The design of the transporter incorporated several innovative features to accommodate the specific requirements of transporting race cars and equipment.
The rear section of the transporter featured a hydraulic lifting mechanism that allowed the loading and unloading of cars with minimal effort. The sides of the transporter could also be lowered to create a ramp for easy access.

The Rennwagen Transporter had a spacious and well-equipped interior, capable of accommodating multiple race cars, spare parts, tools, and other equipment.
The interior was designed with custom storage compartments and racks to securely hold the racing cars and ensure they arrived at each race circuit in optimal condition.
Despite its primary function as a racing transporter, the vehicle also provided comfortable accommodations for the team members traveling with it, including seating, sleeping berths, and amenities for extended journeys.

The Rennwagen Schnelltransporter played a crucial role in supporting Mercedes-Benz's racing endeavors during the 1950s and early 1960s.
It was used to transport legendary Mercedes-Benz race cars such as the W196 and W196 Streamliner, which achieved significant success in Formula One racing during that period.
The transporter traveled extensively across Europe, facilitating the Mercedes-Benz team's participation in races such as the Monaco Grand Prix, the 24 Hours of Le Mans, and the German Grand Prix.

The Rennwagen Schnelltransporter is considered an iconic and pioneering vehicle in the history of motorsport logistics.
Its innovative design and capabilities set a benchmark for future racing transporters and influenced the development of similar vehicles used by other racing teams.
Today, surviving examples of the Rennwagen Transporter are highly prized by collectors and enthusiasts, representing an important chapter in Mercedes-Benz's motorsport heritage.",
13,,Ford Motor Company,"Thunderbird
(1st Generation)",1955,1957,"53,166","The first generation of the Ford Thunderbird, produced from 1955 to 1957, holds a special place in automotive history as one of the most iconic and influential American cars of the post-war era.

The Ford Thunderbird was conceived as a response to the Chevrolet Corvette, which was gaining popularity as a two-seat sports car. Ford aimed to create a similar vehicle that offered both performance and luxury. Development began in the early 1950s under the direction of Lewis D. Crusoe and George Walker, with a focus on creating a car that blended the comfort of a luxury car with the performance of a sports car.

The Thunderbird made its debut as a concept car at the Detroit Auto Show in 1954. The positive reception prompted Ford to fast-track production, and the first-generation Thunderbird went on sale in October 1954 as a 1955 model.

The first-generation Thunderbird featured distinctive styling influenced by jet aircraft design and the prevailing automotive trends of the 1950s. It was designed as a two-seat convertible with a long hood, short rear deck, and sleek lines. The design was elegant and sporty, featuring elements like the signature porthole windows, hood scoop, and chrome accents.

The Thunderbird was initially offered with a 292 cubic inch (4.8L) V8 engine producing 193 horsepower, mated to a three-speed manual transmission or optional automatic transmission. Later in the production run, a more powerful 312 cubic inch (5.1L) V8 engine with up to 225 horsepower became available.

Over the three years of its first generation, the Thunderbird underwent several changes and updates. In 1956, Ford introduced a removable hardtop (fiberglass) option alongside the standard convertible soft top. In 1957, the Thunderbird received a significant redesign, with a larger grille, revised tail fins, and more prominent rear bumper including twin exhausts integrated into the bumper.

The Thunderbird was a sales success, exceeding Ford's initial expectations. It appealed to a wide range of buyers, including those seeking both performance and luxury. The Thunderbird's iconic status was further cemented by its appearances in popular culture, including movies, television shows, and music.

The first-generation Thunderbird played a crucial role in shaping the American automotive landscape, influencing subsequent generations of Thunderbirds and contributing to the development of the personal luxury car segment. Its combination of style, performance, and comfort set a standard for American cars of the era.",

('Kabinenroller' (cabin scooter))",1955,1964,"35,000","The Messerschmitt KR200, often referred to simply as the ""Messerschmitt Kabinenroller"" (cabin scooter), was a microcar produced by the German aircraft manufacturer Messerschmitt from 1955 to 1964.

After World War II, aircraft manufacturers in Germany were prohibited from producing aircraft. This led many companies, including Messerschmitt, to diversify into other areas, such as automotive manufacturing.

The KR200 was designed by Fritz Fend, an aeronautical engineer who had worked for Messerschmitt during the war. He applied his expertise in aircraft design to create a small, three-wheeled vehicle that could be driven with a motorcycle license in Germany. The design featured tandem seating for two occupants and a distinctive bubble canopy, similar to that of an aircraft cockpit.

The Messerschmitt KR200 was introduced in 1955 as a successor to the Messerschmitt KR175, which was produced from 1953 to 1955. The KR200 featured improvements over its predecessor, including a more powerful engine and better handling characteristics.

The KR200 was powered by a single-cylinder, two-stroke engine mounted in the rear of the vehicle. Early models had a 191 cc engine producing around 9.7 horsepower, while later models featured a 191 cc or 198 cc engine with horsepower ratings ranging from 10 to 12.5 horsepower. The KR200 utilized a semi-monocoque chassis and featured a streamlined, aerodynamic body made of steel and aircraft-grade Plexiglas.

Despite its small size and engine, the Messerschmitt KR200 offered surprisingly good performance. It was capable of reaching speeds of around 65 mph (105 km/h), making it suitable for city driving and short trips on highways.

The KR200 became immensely popular in post-war Germany due to its affordability, practicality, and unique design. It was particularly well-suited to the economic conditions of the time and provided an inexpensive mode of transportation for many people.

The Messerschmitt KR200 is remembered as one of the most iconic microcars of the 1950s and 1960s. Its futuristic design and innovative engineering have earned it a place in automotive history. Today, the KR200 is highly sought after by collectors and enthusiasts, and well-maintained examples can command significant prices at auctions.

Production of the KR200 ceased in 1964, as changing market conditions and evolving automotive regulations made it increasingly difficult for microcar manufacturers to remain competitive. Despite its discontinuation, the Messerschmitt KR200 remains a beloved classic car and a symbol of post-war German engineering ingenuity.",
13,,Triumph Motor Company,TR3,1955,1962,"58,236","The Triumph TR3 is a classic British sports car that was produced by the Triumph Motor Company between 1955 and 1962. It is part of the TR series of sports cars, which began with the Triumph TR2.

The Triumph TR3 was introduced as a successor to the TR2, with production starting in 1955. It aimed to build upon the success of its predecessor by refining its design and enhancing performance.

The TR3 retained the classic British sports car styling cues of its predecessor, including a long hood, short rear deck, and distinctive radiator grille. It featured a steel body mounted on a separate chassis, with styling updates such as a new front grille design and exterior trim details. The TR3 also featured a more spacious interior compared to the TR2.

The Triumph TR3 was powered by a 2.0-liter inline-four-cylinder engine, which produced around 95 horsepower. This engine, coupled with a lightweight body and responsive handling, provided lively performance and enjoyable driving dynamics. The TR3 could accelerate from 0 to 60 mph in around 10 seconds and achieve a top speed of over 100 mph, impressive figures for its time.

During its production run, the Triumph TR3 underwent several updates and variants. In 1957, the TR3A was introduced, featuring minor styling changes such as a wider front grille and exterior door handles. The TR3B, introduced in 1962, was a limited-edition model produced for the North American market and featured a more powerful engine borrowed from the Triumph TR4.

Like its predecessor, the Triumph TR3 enjoyed success in motorsport, particularly in rallying and road racing events. It achieved numerous victories and podium finishes in competitions around the world, further enhancing its reputation as a capable and competitive sports car.

The Triumph TR3 is highly regarded among classic car enthusiasts and collectors for its timeless design, spirited performance, and motorsport heritage. Well-preserved examples of the TR3 command premium prices on the classic car market, with enthusiasts appreciating its vintage charm and driving experience.

13,,BMW,507,1956,1959,252,"The BMW 507 is a grand touring convertible that was produced by German automobile manufacturer BMW from 1956 until 1959. Initially intended to be exported to the United States at a rate of thousands per year, it ended up being too expensive, resulting in a total production figure of 252 cars and heavy financial losses for BMW.

The 507 made its debut at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York in the summer of 1955.[13] Production began in November 1956. Hoffman intended the 507 to sell for about $5,000, which he believed would allow a production run of 5,000 units a year. Instead, high production costs pushed the price in Germany to DM 26,500 then DM 29,950.[14][note 1] This drove the U.S. price initially to $9,000 then ultimately $10,500 ($106,500 today).[15] Some of the prominent buyers were John Derek, Elvis Presley who owned two, Hans Stuck, and Georg ""Schorsch"" Meier. Despite the celebrity owners, the 507 never reached more than 10% of the sales volume achieved by Mercedes-Benz 300SL.[16][3]

BMW had intended for 507 to revive the company's sporting image, but the higher production cost led the company to the verge of bankruptcy. BMW lost money on each 507 built and resulted in the company's losses of DM 15 million for 1959.[4][17] The company's losses led to the capital infusion from Herbert Quandt in order to prevent the bankruptcy. The launch of the new models, BMW 700 and 'New Class' 1500 helped the company recover financially.

Only 252 plus two prototypes were built before the production was terminated in 1959.

Renault Dauphine (pronounced [dɔfin])[10] is an economy car manufactured by Renault from 1956 to 1967. Like its predecessor, the Renault 4CV, the Dauphine is a rear-engine, rear-wheel-drive four-door sedan with three-box styling. More than two million Dauphines were built and the design was produced under licence by other manufacturers outside of France. Along with such cars as the Citroën 2CV, Volkswagen Beetle, Morris Minor, Mini and Fiat 600, the Dauphine pioneered the modern European economy car.[8][11][12] Renault marketed numerous variants of the Dauphine, including a luxury version, the Renault Ondine, a decontented version as the Dauphine Teimoso (Brazil, 1965),[13] sporting versions marketed as the Dauphine Gordini and the Ondine Gordini, the 1093 factory racing model, and the Caravelle/Floride, a Dauphine-based two-door coupé and two-door convertible.

As Louis Renault's successor, and as Renault's chairman, Pierre Lefaucheux continued to defy the postwar French Ministry of Industrial Production – which had wanted to convert Renault solely to truck manufacture.[14] Lefaucheux instead saw Renault's survival in automobiles and achieved considerable success with the 4CV, with over 500,000 produced by 1954.

The Dauphine was born during a conversation with Lefaucheux and engineer Fernand Picard. The two agreed the 4CV was appropriate in its postwar context, but that French consumers would soon need a car appropriate for their increasing standard of living,[7] and the onset of the French Autoroute national highway implementation.",

The ""Tour de France"" name was inspired by the car's dominant performance in the Tour de France Automobile endurance race, where it achieved notable success.

The 250 GT TdF was based on the Ferrari 250 GT Berlinetta, but it featured several upgrades to enhance its performance and handling. It was powered by a 3.0-liter Colombo V12 engine, producing around 240 to 260 horsepower, depending on the model year and specification. The bodywork was designed by Scaglietti and featured a lightweight aluminum alloy construction, contributing to its agility and aerodynamic efficiency. The 250 GT TdF boasted a sleek and elegant design, characterized by its long hood, short rear deck, and distinctive grille.

The Ferrari 250 GT Tour de France achieved remarkable success in endurance racing, particularly in events like the Tour de France Automobile, the Targa Florio, and the 24 Hours of Le Mans. It won the Tour de France Automobile race four times consecutively from 1956 to 1959, solidifying its dominance in the competition.

The 300 SL Roadster, with conventional doors, was first exhibited at the Geneva Salon in May 1957.[4][30] The production of an open 300 SL involved redesigning the cockpit with lower sills for improved access.[4][30] The rear suspension also incorporated low-pivot swing axles.[4][30]

The 1,420-kilogram (3,131-pound) roadster weighs 125 kilograms (276 pounds) more than the coupe; with 240 hp (179 kW), the roadster has slightly more power. Its tubular frame was modified to create more space in the boot. The spare tire was placed under the boot floor and, combined with a smaller fuel tank, made room for custom-made fitted luggage. The lower door sill provides a more comfortable entry.[31]

The rear axle was changed to a single-joint arrangement, with its pivot point located 87 millimetres (3.4 in) below the differential centreline.[32] This improved handling (particularly in corners) and comfort. Head engineer Uhlenhaut wanted the new low pivot axle for the coupe but was voted down by the board of directors, which reminded him that 3,000 manufactured axle units remained at the factory and costs were already high for the car.[4] An optional hardtop became available in September 1958.

The late Pierre Elliot Trudeau purchased a silver 1960 Roadster new in that same year. Trudeau's sons, Justin and Sacha, share ownership of the car today. The vehicle was fully restored in the early 2000's.",

The profile of the car is softened and the windshield is now in a single curved plane, like the rear window of the coupe.

Mechanically, the biggest difference from previous models is the introduction of disc brakes as standard. Disc brakes first appeared at Le Mans in 1954 on the Jaguar D-Type . The steering is rack and pinion as on the 140, the engine is still the 3.4  liter 190  hp base and 220  hp in SE version with a cylinder head worked and painted blue. First launched as a coupe and a convertible , the 150 saw the arrival of a roadster in 1958. A sign of the times, it was the 120 roadster, deliberately sporty, which was launched alone and first in 1948. More than an evolution, the 150 is a modern car, which meets the requirements of the American market, but it does not cause a sensation like its illustrious predecessor because it is now a grand touring car and no longer a pure sports car.

It is presented by the brand as Ferrari 250 Gran Turismo Spyder California or simply Ferrari 250 California.[1] Its name is sometimes incorrectly written Spider instead of 'Spyder' which indicates it is similar to a convertible. It was designed by Pininfarina[Note 1] and bodied by Carrozzeria Scaglietti. Starring in the 1986 movie Ferris Bueller's Day Off, it became one of the most popular Ferraris.[2]

The 250 GT California Spyder is not strictly speaking a spyder but a convertible version of the contemporary berlinetta.[3] Powered by the traditional Ferrari V12 engine, it will be produced in a hundred copies, divided almost equally between a long wheel-bases (LWB) from 1957 to 1960 and a short wheel-bases (SWB) from 1960 to 1964.

On May 18, 2008, a midnight blue Ferrari 250 GT California Spyder SWB sold at the ""Ferrari Leggenda e Passione"" auction, organized by Sotheby's, for a record price of EUR 7 million, becoming one of the most expensive retro/classic cars in history. A Ferrari 250 GT California Spyder that belonged to French actor Alain Delon in the 1960s, was purchased on February 5, 2015 for nearly EUR 16.3 million, during an auction in Paris at Artcurial creating a world record for this model at auction.

The American consumers had become fascinated with European auto racing and their relatively small sports cars such that most of the small sports car manufacturers on the old continent sell a large part of their production across the Atlantic.[4]

And while the convertibles were a phenomenal success, especially on the West Coast, two important American dealers - Jon von Neumann in California and Luigi Chinetti in New York - convinced Ferrari to produce a radically sporty convertible[2][5] that would be exclusively destined for America. They assured Enzo Ferrari that there was a market for a hardtop version of a race car, a niche that the luxurious 250 GT Cabriolet Pinin Farina could not fill according to Neumann.[5][6] In an interview, Chinetti explains ""that in Italy it was difficult for the company to seriously consider a convertible as a sports car"".[7][Note 2]

Originally, Enzo Ferrari did not want to produce the California since the 250 GT Cabriolet Pinin Farina, popular in Europe, was already available in the company's catalog. Nevertheless, if he had not accepted Chinetti and Neumann's proposal, it is very likely that they would have acquired 250 GT Berlinettas ""Tour de France"" or SWB, and entrusted their transformation into a spider to Scaglietti. This is indeed what they did in 1967 to some Ferrari 275 GTB/4 while Ferrari was opposed to it.[7]

This is how the 250 GT California Spyder was born, whose name is a nod to its future Californian customers; its race car performance, its limited number of examples and its specifications to each model,[5][8] surely explain the interest it still has today. Initially presented as a prototype in 1957, series production began in the second quarter of 1958.[9]

At the 1960 Geneva International Motor Show, the 250 GT California Spyder - until then produced on the long chassis of the Ferrari 250 GT Berlinetta ""Tour de France"", which had a wheelbase of 2.60 m - was replaced by a short chassis version with a wheelbase reduced to 2.40 m, similar to the treatment recently received by the berlinetta on which it was based.

The original Fiat 500 featured a rear-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout and a tiny 479cc two-cylinder engine mounted in the rear. Despite its small size, the Fiat 500 could accommodate four passengers, although it was more comfortable for two adults and two children. The car quickly gained popularity in Italy and became a symbol of Italian style and ingenuity. It was also exported to many other countries and became popular across Europe.

Over the years, Fiat introduced several variants and updates to the 500. These included different engine sizes, body styles (such as the Giardiniera estate version), and trim levels. In 1965, Fiat introduced the 500F, which featured various improvements over the original model, including a synchromesh gearbox and a more powerful engine. The Fiat 500D, introduced in 1960, featured a more powerful engine and additional creature comforts.

The Fiat 500 became deeply ingrained in popular culture and is often associated with the Italian way of life, especially in urban settings. It featured prominently in movies, television shows, and advertisements, further cementing its status as a cultural icon.

The Dino 246 featured a lightweight tubular spaceframe chassis and a mid-mounted 2.4-liter V6 engine. The engine was the first V6 powerplant to be used in Formula One racing and was highly innovative for its time. The Dino 246's V6 engine produced around 280 to 300 horsepower, depending on the specific version and tuning.

The Ferrari Dino 246 enjoyed considerable success on the racetrack, particularly during the 1958 and 1959 Formula One seasons. It competed against formidable opponents such as the Vanwall, Cooper, and BRM teams. The Dino 246 secured several victories and podium finishes, with drivers such as Mike Hawthorn, Peter Collins, and Phil Hill behind the wheel. Notably, Mike Hawthorn won the 1958 Formula One World Championship driving a Ferrari Dino 246, becoming the first British Formula One World Champion.

The car's bodywork was made by Jensen Motors and the vehicles were assembled at BMC's MG Works in Abingdon, alongside the corporation's MG models.

During its production life, the car changed from an open sports car, albeit with a child-transporting 2+2 option, to a sports convertible. In 1963, 91.5 per cent of all Austin-Healey 3000 cars were exported; mostly to North America. The 3-litre 3000 was a highly successful car, which won its class in many European rallies in its heyday and is still raced in classic car competitions by enthusiasts today.

Minus a brief hiatus, original Minis were built for four decades and sold during five, from the last year of the 1950s into the last year of the 20th century, over a single generation, as fastbacks, estates, and convertibles.

The original Mini is considered an icon of 1960s British popular culture.[13][14][15][16] Its space-saving transverse engine and front-wheel drive layout – allowing 80% of the area of the car's floorpan to be used for passengers and luggage – influenced a generation of car makers.[17] In 1999, the Mini was voted the second-most influential car of the 20th century, behind the Ford Model T, and ahead of the Citroën DS and Volkswagen Beetle.[18][19] The front-wheel-drive, transverse-engine layout were used in many other ""supermini"" style car designs such as Honda N360 (1967), Nissan Cherry (1970), and Fiat 127 (1971). The layout was also adapted for larger subcompact designs.

This distinctive two-door car was designed for BMC by Sir Alec Issigonis. It was manufactured at the Longbridge plant in Birmingham, England located next to BMC's headquarters and at the former Morris Motors plant at Cowley near Oxford, in the Victoria Park/Zetland British Motor Corporation (Australia) factory in Sydney, Australia, and later also in Spain (Authi), Belgium, Italy (Innocenti), Chile, Malta, Portugal, South Africa, Uruguay, Venezuela, and Yugoslavia (IMV).",

13,,BMW,700 Sport,1959,1965,"188,211","The BMW 700 is a small rear-engined car which was produced by BMW in various models from August 1959 to November 1965. It was the first BMW automobile with a monocoque structure. The 700 was a sales success at a time when BMW was close to financial ruin.[5] The 700 was also successful in its class in motorsport, both in its stock form and as the basis of a racing special called the 700RS.

More than 188,000 were sold before production ended in November 1965. Upon discontinuing the 700, BMW left the economy car market.

Wolfgang Denzel, the distributor of BMW cars in Austria, commissioned Giovanni Michelotti to prepare concept sketches based on a lengthened BMW 600 chassis.[6] In January 1958, Denzel was awarded a development contract for the 700. Denzel presented a prototype to BMW's management in July 1958.[7] The concept, a two-door coupé with a slanted roof, was generally well received, but objections were raised about the limited passenger space.[6][7] BMW decided to produce two versions, the coupe, and a two-door sedan with a taller, longer roof.[6]

The engineer responsible for the chassis and suspension was Willy Black, who had designed and engineered the 600. The drivetrain and suspension were similar to those of the 600, with a rear-mounted flat-twin engine powering the rear wheels, Dubonnet leading arm suspension at the front, and semi trailing arm suspension at the rear. The 700 used a steel monocoque structure, and was the first BMW automobile to do so.[6]

The engine was an enlarged version of that used in the R67 motorcycle and the 600. With a bore of 78 millimetres (3.1 in) and 73 millimetres (2.9 in) of stroke, the engine displaced 697 cubic centimetres (42.5 cu in). The engine originally used a single Solex 34PCI carburetor and had a compression ratio of 7.5:1, resulting in a power output of 30 horsepower (22 kW).

The coupé and saloon versions of the 700 were shown at the 1959 Frankfurt Motor Show.[8] BMW's internal model code was E107, with the later cabriolet becoming the E110. After the show, BMW received 25,000 orders for 700s.[9] Production of the BMW 700 coupe began in August 1959, with the saloon version following in December.[6]

The large number of orders was welcome news for BMW, which was in a financial crisis. In December 1959, shareholders blocked a proposal by BMW's supervisory board to sell BMW to Daimler-Benz.[10] The subsequent heavy investment in BMW by Herbert Quandt[11] has been attributed in part to the success of the 700.[9][12]

By April 1960, production of the 700 was at 155 cars per day.

The first variant of the 700 to appear after the original coupé and saloon was the 700 Sport in August 1960. Available only as a coupé, the Sport used an uprated engine with a pair of Solex carburetors and a 9.0:1 compression ratio. This brought the power output to 40 PS (29 kW). The Sport also had a rear anti-roll bar.[6] A ribbed oil pan was used to reduce the oil temperature of the more powerful engine.[13] The 700 Sport was renamed the 700 CS in 1963.[6]

The 700 Cabriolet was introduced shortly after the 700 Sport, and was available only with the Sport's 40 horsepower engine. The convertible body was made by Karosserie Baur of Stuttgart.[6][14] 2,592 convertibles were built.[6]

A Saxomat semi-automatic transmission was offered as an option on 700s from September 1960.[13]

The 700 Luxus (deluxe) replaced the original saloon in 1962.[6] A longer wheelbase variant, the LS, was also added, extending the wheelbase by 16 centimetres (6.3 in).[15]

In February 1963, the size of the inlet valves in the 700's base engine was increased. This increased power to 32 PS (24 kW).[15]

The final development of the 700 was the 700 LS Coupé of 1964. This was a long-wheelbase coupé with the Sport engine. 1,730 LS Coupés were built.[6]

Production of the BMW 700 ended in November 1965. By that time, the successful New Class cars had established themselves in the marketplace. High demand for these larger cars with larger profit margins led BMW to stop making economy cars.[6] BMW eventually returned to the economy car market in 2002 with the Mini.",

The E-Type's claimed 150 miles per hour (240 km/h) top speed,[4] sub-7-second 0 to 60 mph (97 km/h) acceleration, largely unitary body construction, front and rear independent suspension with disc brakes, mounted inboard at the rear, and rack-and-pinion steering, distinguished the car and spurred industry-wide changes.[5]

The E-Type was based on Jaguar's D-Type racing car, which had won the 24 Hours of Le Mans for three consecutive years beginning in 1955.[6]

The E-Type employed what was, for the early 1960s, a novel design principle, with a front subframe carrying the engine, front suspension and front bodywork bolted directly to the body tub. No ladder frame chassis, as was common at the time, was needed and as such the first cars weighed only 1,315 kg (2,899 lb).[7]

Ford Motor Company and Hess & Eisenhardt, custom automobile builders in Cincinnati, Hio, worked together to create the most modern open parade limousine of its day. The X-100, originally painted midnight blue, was packed with numerous special features including two radio telephones, auxiliary jump seats for extra passengers, interior floodlights to illuminate the president at night, and retractable steps for Secret Service agents. A hydraulically-operated rear seat could be raised  nearly elen inches to give crowds a better look at the president and his guests. The most noteable feature was a series of removable steel and transparent plastic roof panels that could be installed in varios combinations from an enclosed hardtop to a totally open car. The X-100 carried no armour or weapons, because the purpose of the car was to make the president more visible, not to provide protection. The philosophy changed completely after November 22, 1063.

On the day, President John F. Kennedy was assassinated while riding in the X-100 through the streets of Dallas, Texas. President Kennedy's wife, Jacqueline, sat next to the President in the rear seat. Also riding in the car was John Connally, then governor of Texas, and his wife, Nellie. Governor Connally was seated in the jump seat directly in fron of the president and was also wounded in the attack. Neither Mrs. Kennedy nor Mrs. Connally were injured. Two secret Service agents were in the front seats.

When the X-100 was retired from active duty, Ford Motor Company donated the vehicle to the Henry Ford Museum & Greenfield Village in Dearborn, Michigan. In addition to the X-100, the Museum has several other presidential parade vehicles on display: The 1939 Lincoln V12 vonvertible (the 'Sunshine Special') used by Franklin D. Roosevelt; the 1950 Lincoln Cosmopolitan (the 'Bubble Top') which was used by Presidents Truman and Eisenhower; and the 1972 Lincoln used by Presidents Ford, Carter, Reagan and Bush.
The Reagan/Bush car is the last presidential parade vehicle that will be given to any museum. The Secret Service will destroy all future presential vehicles in tests so that the complex electronic and security devices will remain confidential.

Rebuilding the X-100:
Immediately following the assassination, a special task force decided that the most practical way to prevent a similar event from reoccuring was to rebuild the X-100 from the ground up. The car was returned to the Hess & Eisenhardt company in December 1963 for what became known as the 'quick-fix' - a complete redesign that was to cost more than $500,000.

The basic elements of the 'quick-fix' included:
-a new black paint job
-adding armour plating and bullet-resistant glass to protect the vehicle's passenger compartments
-the addition of a permanent, non-removable top (or 'greenhouse') to accommodate the transparent armour
-replacing the original engine with a hand-built, high compression unit with 17% greater power
-solid aluminum rims inside the tires to make them flat-proof
-a fuel tank filled with porous foam to prevent explosion in case of penetration by a bullet
-a second air-conditioning unit in the trunk
-improved telecommunications devices
-reinforcement of some mechanical and structural components to accept the added weight of the armour
-complete retrimming of the rear compartment to eliminat the damage that was caused by the assassination

The finished product weighed about one ton more than the original X-100 and was completed in May 1964. The X-100 was put back into service and was used by Presidents Johnson, Nixon, Ford and Carter before being retired in 1977",

Bristol engines for the AC Ace two-seater sports car had recently been discontinued so AC agreed, provided a suitable engine could be found. Shelby went to Chevrolet to see if they would provide him with engines, but not wanting to add competition to the Corvette, Chevrolet declined. However, Ford wanted a car that could compete with the Corvette and they happened to have a brand new engine which could be used in this endeavor: the Windsor 3.6-litre (221 cu in) engine – a new lightweight, thin-wall cast small-block V8. Ford provided Shelby with two engines.

AC exported completed, painted, and trimmed cars (less engine and gearbox) to Shelby who then finished the cars in his workshop in Los Angeles by installing the engine and gearbox and correcting any bodywork flaws caused by the car's passage by sea.

It was announced and its details first published on 19 September 1962.[5] Variants include the MGB GT three-door 2+2 coupé (1965–1980), the six-cylinder sports car and coupé MGC (1967–69), and the eight-cylinder 2+2 coupé, the MGB GT V8 (1973–76).

Replacing the MGA in 1962, production of the MGB and its variants continued until 1980. Sales for the MGB, MGC and MGB GT V8 combined totaled 523,836 cars. After a 12-year hiatus, the MGB re-entered production as the heavily modified MG RV8 with a limited run of 2,000 cars before finally being replaced in 1995 by the MG F.

Development of the MGB started at least as early as 1958 with the prototype known by its Abingdon codename; MG EX205.[6] In structure the car was a progressive, modern design in 1962, using a unitary structure, instead of the traditional body-on-frame construction used on both the MGA and MG T-types and the MGB's rival, the Triumph TR series.[7] However, components such as brakes and suspension were developments of the earlier 1955 MGA, with the B-Series engine having its origins in 1947. The lightweight design reduced manufacturing costs while adding to overall vehicle strength. Wind-up windows were standard, and a comfortable driver's compartment offered plenty of legroom. A parcel shelf was fitted behind the seats.

The MGB was one of the first cars to feature controlled crumple zones designed to protect the driver and passenger in a 30 mph (48 km/h) impact with an immovable barrier (200 ton).[8][9] Nevertheless, the British AA motoring association has described the car, like many other classic models, as much less safe than modern cars. The issue received public attention following a 2013 case in which a driver in a hired 1963 MGB was killed in a collision with a taxi.",

(British Leyland)",Spitfire,1962,1980,"315,000","The Triumph Spitfire is a British sports car and manufactured over five production iterations between 1962 and 1980. Styled for Standard-Triumph in 1957 by Italian designer Giovanni Michelotti, the Spitfire was introduced at the London Motor Show in 1962.

Popular in street and rally racing, Spitfires won numerous SCCA National Sports Car Championships in F and G Production classes; won its class at the 1964 Tour de France rally, coming in second overall, and won the 1964 Geneva Rally. In 1965, a Spitfire won its class in the Alpine Rally.[7] The model was named after the famed Supermarine Spitfire fighter plane of World War II.

The Spitfire was conceived of by Standard-Triumph to compete in the small sports car market against the Austin-Healey Sprite. The Sprite used the drive train of the Austin A30/A35 in a new lightweight body, while the Spitfire used mechanicals from the Herald saloon. Where the Austin A30 used unitary construction, the Herald used a separate backbone chassis — which Triumph was able to downsize, saving the cost of developing a completely new chassis-body unit.

Giovanni Michelotti, who had designed the Herald, styled the bodywork, which featured wind-up windows (in contrast to the Sprite and Midget, which used side curtains) and a cowl composed of the bonnet and wings that opened forward for engine access. The Spitfire's introduction was delayed by its company's financial troubles in the early 1960's and was subsequently announced shortly after Standard Triumph was taken over by Leyland Motors. While taking stock of their new acquisition, Leyland officials found Michelotti's prototype under a dust sheet in a factory corner, and quickly approved it for production.",
14,,Ford,Cortina MKI,1962,1966,1 million,"The Ford Cortina Mark I, often referred to as the Cortina MkI, was a compact car produced by Ford of Britain between 1962 and 1966.

The Cortina MkI was introduced in September 1962 as Ford's new family car. It was designed to compete in the increasingly popular market for small family cars in the UK.

The Cortina MkI was designed by Roy Brown Jr., an American designer who had previously worked on the Ford Edsel. The design of the Cortina was influenced by contemporary American cars, with its clean lines and simple styling. It was offered initially as a two-door sedan and later as a four-door sedan and a five-door estate (station wagon).

The Cortina MkI was initially offered with a range of inline-four engines, including 1.1-liter, 1.2-liter, and 1.5-liter units. These engines provided adequate performance for the time, and the Cortina was praised for its lively handling and responsive steering.

The Cortina MkI was an immediate success, quickly becoming one of the best-selling cars in the UK. Its combination of affordability, practicality, and stylish design appealed to a wide range of customers, from families to young professionals.

The Cortina MkI achieved considerable success in motorsport, particularly in rallying. It won numerous races and championships, including the prestigious 1964 and 1965 British Saloon Car Championships. The Cortina's success in motorsport helped to enhance its reputation for performance and durability.

The Cortina MkI received several updates and revisions during its production run, including changes to trim levels and engine options. In 1966, the Cortina MkII was introduced, featuring a redesigned body and updated mechanical components. The MkI remained in production for a short time alongside the MkII before being discontinued.

Overall, the Ford Cortina MkI was a landmark car for Ford, helping to establish the company as a major player in the UK automotive market. Its combination of style, performance, and affordability made it a popular choice for millions of drivers and cemented its place in automotive history.

The Cortina was one of the most important vehicles from the '60s British car industry. It was the car that paved the way to sport-compact coupe vehicles.

Ford designed a concept-car in North America, named Cardinal. But ultimately, it decided that it was too small for Americans taste. So, they asked the British arm if that car would fit into their pans. The answer was ""yes,"" and the first car rolled down from the assembly line in 1962. But it wasn't quite like the original, and it used the name Cortina instead.

The car was designed by Rory Brown Jr., who was sent into the U.K. after the disastrous design of the Ford Edsel. This time, he did it right. It was a light car, available in three body shapes: coupe, four-door sedan, and station wagon. They shared the same front fascia with a pair of round headlights and trapezoidal chromed grille. The descending bodywork lines were made the car looks faster. The round taillights split into three areas were a delight and became a classic theme design.

Inside, the Cortina featured a flat, straight dashboard with only a bump over the instrument cluster. It offered just about enough room for four passengers, with tilting front seats. There were not many features inside the cabin, allowing the carmaker to sell the vehicle with big discounts.

The drivetrain was simple, with an inline-four under the hood and a four-speed, all-synchromesh gearbox. To promote the car, Ford worked with Lotus to create a sporty version, and that's how the Lotus Cortina appeared on the market. A light, agile, fast vehicle that won many races on the race-tracks' tarmac and the gravel in rally stages.",

It featured a 1,570 cc twin cam engine and other mechanical components shared with the Alfa Romeo Giulia and carried a 105 series chassis number,[2] but was a purpose built sports racing car, with a tubular spaceframe chassis built in the province of Perugia by SAI Ambrosini and the light all-aluminium bodywork was made by Zagato, final assembly was made Delta of Udine, with Carlo Chiti initially on board as a consultant before becoming the project leader. The firm soon changed its name to Auto-Delta and relocated to its current site in Settimo Milanese, on the outskirts of Milan, not far from the Alfa Romeo Portello Plant.[3]

It has disc brakes and independent suspension. The result was a lightweight coupé of only 650 kilograms (1,430 lb)[4] and top speed of 134 miles per hour (216 km/h). The TZ was built both for street and racing trim, with the latest racing versions producing up to 160 brake horsepower (120 kW). Alfa's twin-spark cylinder head, as also used in their GTA, contributed to the speed of the TZ; the standard Giulia alloy block with wet steel liners was installed at an angle under the hood of the TZ to improve airflow.

Aiding the TZ in its quest for performance was the treatment of the rear bodywork. Incorporating the research of Dr. Wunibald Kamm, the TZ used a style called coda tronca in Italian, meaning ""short tail."", otherwise known as the Kamm tail. The principle is that unless an aircraft-like extended tail is incorporated, which is not practical for an automobile, there is little, if any, increase in drag and a marked decrease in lift or even some downforce by simply chopping off a portion of the tail. Zagato had previously proved the success of this tail treatment in their coda tronca Sprint Zagato sports-racing cars, and it was a natural evolution to adapt this to the Giulia TZ.

The car debuted at the 1963 FISA Monza Cup, where TZs took the first four places in the prototype category. At the beginning of 1964 the TZ was homologated (100 units were needed for homologation) to the Gran Turismo category.[5] After homologation it started to take more class wins in Europe and North-America. Of the first TZ, 112 units were built between 1963 and 1965.

(1st Generation)",1964,1973,"2,978,271","The Ford Mustang is an iconic American automobile that has played a significant role in automotive history, particularly in the realm of muscle cars and sports cars. The project was lead by Lee Iacocca who later went to work for Chrysler in the early '80's.

The Ford Mustang made its debut on April 17, 1964, at the New York World's Fair. It was introduced as a 1965 model, but its unveiling in 1964 generated immense excitement. The Mustang was marketed as a ""pony car,"" a new class of affordable, compact sports cars with long hoods and short rear decks.

Early Years (First Generation: 1964-1973): (Model shown is a 1970) The first-generation Mustang, often referred to as the ""1964½"" model, was an instant success. It offered various engine options, body styles (coupe, convertible, and fastback), and customization choices, appealing to a wide range of customers. It quickly became one of Ford's most successful launches:
UPGRADES TO EARLY YEARS:
-Several changes were made at the traditional opening of the new model year (beginning August 1964), including the addition of back-up lights on some models, the introduction of alternators to replace generators, an upgrade of the six-cylinder engine from 170 to 200 cu in (2.8 to 3.3 L) with an increase from 101 to 120 hp (75 to 89 kW), and an upgrade of the V8 engine from 260 to 289 cu in (4.3 to 4.7 L) with an increase from 164 to 210 hp (122 to 157 kW). The rush into production included some unusual quirks, such as the horn ring bearing the 'Ford Falcon' logo covered by a trim ring with a 'Ford Mustang' logo. These characteristics made enough difference to warrant designation of the 121,538 early versions as ""1964½"" Mustangs, a distinction that has endured with purists.
-Ford's designers began drawing up larger versions even as the original was achieving sales success, and while ""Iacocca later complained about the Mustang's growth, he did oversee the 1967 redesign.""[35] From 1967 until 1973, the Mustang got bigger but not necessarily more powerful.[36] The Mustang was facelifted, giving the Mustang a more massive look overall and allowing a big block engine to be offered for the first time. Front and rear end styling was more pronounced, and the ""twin cove"" instrument panel offered a thicker crash pad and larger gauges. Hardtop, fastback, and convertible body styles continued as before. Around this time, the Mustang was paired with a Mercury variant, called the Cougar, which used its own styling cues, such as a ""prowling cat"" logo and hidden quad headlamps. New safety regulations by the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) for 1967 included an energy-absorbing steering column and wheel, 4-way emergency flashers, and a dual-circuit hydraulic braking system, and softer interior knobs. The 1968 models received revised side scoops, steering wheel, and gasoline caps. Side marker lights were also added that year, and cars built after January 1, 1968, included shoulder belts for both front seats on coupes. The 1968 models also introduced a new 302 cu in (4.9 L) V8 engine, designed with Federal emissions regulations in mind.

The 1969 restyle ""added more heft to the body as width and length again increased. Weight went up markedly too.""[35] Due to the larger body and revised front end styling, the 1969 models (but less so in 1970) had a notable aggressive stance. The 1969 models featured ""quad headlamps"" which disappeared to make way for a wider grille and a return to standard headlamps in the 1970 models. This switch back to standard headlamps was an attempt to tame the aggressive styling of the 1969 model, which some felt was too extreme and hurt sales, but 1969 production exceeded the 1970 total.

Evolution and Expansion (Second Generation: 1974-1978): The second-generation Mustang, introduced in 1974, underwent significant changes due to the oil crisis and changing market demands. It was based on the Ford Pinto platform and was smaller and more fuel-efficient than its predecessor. However, it received mixed reviews from enthusiasts.

Rebirth (Third Generation: 1979-1993): In 1979, Ford launched the third-generation Mustang, often referred to as the ""Fox-body"" Mustang. It marked a return to the Mustang's performance roots, offering a range of engines, including turbocharged four-cylinders, V6s, and V8s. It gained popularity both on the street and in motorsport.

Modernization and Globalization (Fourth Generation: 1994-2004): The fourth-generation Mustang, introduced in 1994, featured a more modern design while retaining the Mustang's classic styling cues. It was offered with powerful V6 and V8 engines, and special editions like the SVT Cobra and Mach 1 appealed to enthusiasts.

Retro Revival (Fifth Generation: 2005-2014): The fifth-generation Mustang, launched in 2005, brought back the iconic styling cues of the original Mustang while incorporating modern technology and performance. It was well-received for its retro design and potent V8 engine options, such as the 5.0-liter Coyote engine.

Global Icon (Sixth Generation: 2015-present): The current sixth-generation Mustang, introduced in 2015, represents a global approach to the Mustang's design and engineering. It is offered with turbocharged four-cylinder engines alongside V6 and V8 options. The Mustang continues to be a symbol of American automotive culture worldwide.

Throughout its history, the Ford Mustang has undergone numerous transformations, but its legacy as an American icon of performance, style, and affordability remains intact. It has inspired generations of automotive enthusiasts and continues to be a dominant force in the sports car market.",

The car was the first supercar with a rear mid-engined two-seat layout, although the concept was first seen in a production road car with René Bonnet's Matra Djet, introduced in 1964.[4] This layout has since become the standard for high-performance sports and supercars.[5] When released, it was the fastest production road car.[6]

The Miura was originally conceived by Lamborghini's engineering team, which designed the car in its spare time against the wishes[citation needed] of company founder Ferruccio Lamborghini, who preferred powerful yet sedate grand touring cars over the race car-derived machines produced by local rival Ferrari.

The Miura's rolling chassis was presented at the 1965 Turin Auto Show, and the prototype P400 debuted at the 1966 Geneva Motor Show. It received stellar receptions from showgoers and the motoring press alike, each impressed by Marcello Gandini's sleek styling and the car's revolutionary mid-engine design.

The Porsche 910 was entered in mid 1966, starting with the 1966 European Hill Climb Championship from Sierre to Crans-Montana in Switzerland. Engines used were 1991cc 6-cylinder (901/20, Weber 46IDA3C) with 200 hp (149 kW), 1991cc 6-cylinder (901/21, MFI Slide Throttle) with 220 hp (164 kW), 2195cc 6-cylinder (907, MFI) with 270 hp (201 kW), or the 1981cc 8-cylinder (771, MFI) with up to 275 hp (205 kW). The 8 cylinder version was referred to as 910/8.

The 910 was only raced for about one year by the factory. The main class rivals were the Ferrari-fielded Dino 206 P, overall victories on fast tracks against the much more powerful and faster Ford GT40 for example, or another class competitor Ferrari Prototypes proved unrealistic.

At the 1000 km Nürburgring in 1967, a fleet of six factory cars were entered in an attempt to score the first overall win in Porsche's home event. Two of the three 8-cyl broke, and the remaining one finished fourth.

15,,Porsche,914,1969,1976,"118,978","The Porsche 914 or VW-Porsche 914 is a mid-engined sports car designed, manufactured and marketed collaboratively by Volkswagen and Porsche from 1969 until 1976. It was only available as a targa-topped two-seat roadster powered by either a flat-4 or flat-six engine.

Originally intending to sell the vehicle with a flat four-cylinder engine as a Volkswagen and with a flat six-cylinder engine as a Porsche (916), Porsche decided during development that having Volkswagen and Porsche models sharing the same body would be risky for business in the American market, and convinced Volkswagen to allow them to sell both versions as Porsches in North America.[6]

On March 1, 1968, the first 914 prototype was presented. However, development became complicated after the death of Volkswagen's chairman, Heinrich Nordhoff, on April 12, 1968. His successor, Kurt Lotz, was not connected with the Porsche dynasty and the verbal agreement between Volkswagen and Porsche fell apart.[7]

In Lotz's opinion, Volkswagen had all rights to the model, and no incentive to share it with Porsche if they would not share in tooling expenses. With this decision, the price and marketing concept for the 914 had failed before series production had begun. As a result, the price of the chassis went up considerably, and the 914/6 ended up costing only a bit less than the 911T, Porsche's next lowest priced car.

The Porsche 916 is a rare variant of the Porsche 914. It was intended to be a higher-performance version, but ultimately only a few prototypes were produced, and the model never went into full production. There were only 11 Porsche 916 units built, making it an extremely rare and sought-after collector's item among Porsche enthusiasts.

The 914 was Motor Trend's Import Car of the Year for 1970.",

The story of the Red Pig begins in the late 1960s when Mercedes-Benz engineers, led by Erich Waxenberger, sought to demonstrate the performance capabilities of the newly introduced 6.3-liter V8 engine. They decided to enter a modified version of the 300SEL 6.3 into the 1969 24 Hours of Spa endurance race.

The standard 300SEL 6.3 was already a powerful luxury sedan, but significant modifications were made to turn it into a competitive race car. These modifications included fender flares to accommodate wider wheels and tires, upgraded suspension components, lightweight body panels, and a roll cage for added safety.

The 300SEL 6.3's 6.3-liter V8 engine was tuned to produce around 300 horsepower, a considerable increase from its stock output. This gave the Red Pig impressive straight-line speed and acceleration, despite its large size and weight.

The Red Pig made its racing debut at the 1969 24 Hours of Spa endurance race in Belgium. Its unconventional appearance, with bright red paint and oversized fender flares, earned it the nickname ""Red Pig"" from spectators and journalists.

Against all odds, the Red Pig performed admirably during the race, surprising many with its speed and endurance. Despite encountering mechanical issues, it finished a remarkable 2nd in its class and 11th overall, ahead of many purpose-built race cars.

16,,Citroen,GS,1970,1986,2.5 million,"The Citroën GS is a front-engine, front-drive, four or five door, five passenger family car manufactured and marketed by Citroën in two series: for model years 1970–1979 in fastback saloon and estate bodystyles and subsequently as the GSA for model years 1980–1986 in hatchback and estate body styles – the latter after a facelift. Combined production reached approximately 2.5 million.

Noted for its aerodynamic body shape with a drag coefficient of 0.318, [4] fully independent hydro-pneumatic brakes and self-levelling suspension, and air-cooled flat-four engine, the GS was styled by Robert Opron, with a low nose, a two-box silhouette, semi-enclosed rear wheels and a sharply vertical Kamm-tail.

When the GS was named the European Car of the Year for 1971, the design was noted as technologically advanced,[5][6] with class leading comfort, safety and aerodynamics.

Unlike the 2CV, Ami, DS and SM, the GS was never officially imported to the USA. A US export model was nearly finished when Citroën withdrew from the US market, with a few dozen cars brought over in 1971 for testing purposes and to be displayed in showrooms. After the project was cancelled, these orphaned cars were sold, mostly to employees of the dealerships.[10] A sealed-beam headlight design was developed, and although never used as intended it was installed in Yugoslav- and Indonesian-assembled models as it made light replacement cheaper and easier.

The GS took 14 years to develop from initial design to launch.

Most notably, it featured Citroën's signature hydropneumatic suspension system, which provided a smooth and comfortable ride, even at high speeds. It also boasted self-leveling suspension, power-assisted steering, and advanced braking systems.

Powering the Citroën SM was a range of Maserati-sourced engines, including a 2.7-liter V6 and later a 3.0-liter V6, both equipped with multiple carburetors. These engines delivered impressive performance, with top speeds exceeding 220 km/h (137 mph), making the SM one of the fastest production cars of its time.

The Citroën SM received widespread acclaim for its combination of style, comfort, and performance. It won the Motor Trend Car of the Year award in 1972 and was praised by automotive journalists for its innovation and driving experience.

Despite its technological sophistication and critical acclaim, the Citroën SM faced challenges in the market, including high production costs and the oil crisis of the 1970s. Citroën ultimately produced around 13,000 units before discontinuing the model in 1975.

16,,Chrysler,Plymouth Superbird,1970,1970,"1,920","The Dodge Superbird is an iconic American muscle car that was produced for the 1970 model year. It was a high-performance variant of the Dodge Charger, specifically designed for NASCAR racing. The history of the Dodge Superbird is closely tied to the competition between American automakers in NASCAR during the late 1960s and early 1970s.

In the late 1960s, Chrysler Corporation, Dodge's parent company, was eager to dominate NASCAR racing, which was experiencing a surge in popularity. The key to success in NASCAR was not just engine power, but also aerodynamics, especially on high-speed tracks like Daytona and Talladega.

Chrysler engineers and designers, led by Larry Rathgeb and Tom Hoover, began experimenting with aerodynamic modifications to the Dodge Charger in order to make it more competitive on the racetrack. They drew inspiration from the success of the Plymouth Superbird, a similar aerodynamically enhanced version of the Plymouth Road Runner, which had been introduced by Chrysler's sister company Plymouth in 1970.

The Dodge Charger Daytona, introduced in 1969, was the precursor to the Superbird. It featured a longer nose cone and a towering rear wing, which significantly improved aerodynamics and stability at high speeds. However, it was not as successful as Chrysler had hoped.

In response, Chrysler decided to create an even more extreme version based on the Dodge Charger platform, resulting in the Dodge Superbird. The Superbird featured a distinctive aerodynamic nose cone, flush-mounted grille, and an enormous rear wing mounted on tall vertical struts. These aerodynamic enhancements dramatically improved stability and downforce, allowing the car to achieve higher speeds on NASCAR tracks.

Under NASCAR rules at the time, manufacturers were required to produce a minimum number of street-legal versions of their race cars in order to qualify them for competition. As a result, Chrysler produced just enough Superbirds to meet the homologation requirements, estimated to be around 1,920 units.

Despite its striking appearance and impressive performance on the racetrack, the Dodge Superbird faced criticism from some quarters for its extreme styling. The car's unique design made it instantly recognizable, but it also made it polarizing among enthusiasts and collectors.

Today, the Dodge Superbird is regarded as one of the most collectible and sought-after American muscle cars of all time. Its limited production numbers, combined with its association with NASCAR racing, have made it a highly desirable car among collectors and enthusiasts alike.",

Short Family Experience: owned a red '530i' when we returned back to Canada to Toronto from living in Brussels for close to two years. I remember this red beast very well. It was very fast, hard a beautiful engine roar, but was quite useless in the snow!!!! For instance, whilst en route to Montreal from Toronto in the middle of the winter, the car slid off of the outside lane on the 401 ending up backwards in the highway medium.

Short Family Experience: We owned a new red one from 2008 to 2013. Fantastic car. One little factoid: it had a bladder gas tank which meant that filling it in cold weather was interesting. One had to slow down the rate of flow from the gas pump to allow the bladder tank to expand without spilling out at the top. The reason for the bladder tank design was to not have to have the gas tank vented to the atmosphere which of course would have meant passive emissions from the fuel.",
